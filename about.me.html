<h1> About me <h1>
  <p> My name is Junior Marcelo Vasquez and I am 2nd year HIP Mentee. Long ago I was born and raised at Central LA and I now live at Canoga Park. I love helping and tend to be altruistic
    My dream is to become either a mechanical engineer or environmental because they both interest me and I believe that those careers are fundamental parts of our society today. </p>
